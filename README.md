# Charm for Docker

This charm deploys the [Docker](http://docker.com) engine within Juju. Docker 
is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run 
distributed applications in containers.

Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete file system that 
contains everything needed to run an application on a server.

Docker focuses on distributing applications as containers that can be quickly 
assembled from components that are run the same on different servers without 
environmental dependencies. This eliminates the friction between development, 
QA, and production environments.

Most people will want to extend this charm to make their Docker container or 
application deployable from Juju. The 
[Charm layer](https://github.com/juju-solutions/layer-docker) can be extended to
include docker container along with additional operational code. Please refer
to the [Charm Layers](https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/developer-layers)
documentation on [jujucharms.com](https://jujucharms.com/docs) for more 
information.

# States

The following states are set by this layer:

* `nvidia-docker.supported`

  This state is set when supported GPU hardware is detected.

* `nvidia-docker.installed`

  This state is set once CUDA-related packages are installed and configured.


## Using the Docker Charm

Docker does not require anything by default so you can deploy the Charm by the 
following command.

```
juju deploy docker
```

**NOTE**: You can ask Juju to deploy a different release of Ubuntu by using the
`--series` and the code name of the release "trusty" for 14.04 and "xenial" for
16.04.

Once deployed you have a docker-engine running on a unit in Juju. You can open
a session to that unit and issue the `docker` command to start using it 
right away.

```
juju ssh docker/0
...
$ docker run hello-world
```

## Scale out Usage

Scaling out the Charm is as simple as adding additional docker units
with Juju `add-unit` command to expand your cluster. However, you will need an
SDN solution to provide cross host networking. See the Known Limitations and 
issues about this.

# Configuration

- docker-opts : Pass through configuration to the docker daemon, such as
configuring the docker daemon to allow an insecure private registry.

```
juju config docker docker-opts='--insecure-registry=http://my.insecure.registry:5000'
```

- enable-cgroups = (false) : To enable memory and swap on system using GNU GRUB 
(GNU GRand Unified Bootloader) set this value to 'true'. It updates the 
`/etc/default/grub` file setting `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` to 
`cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1`. The default value is 'false'. 
**WARNING**: changing this option will initiate a reboot of the host - use with
caution on as your containers will shutdown when this configuration value is 
set. 

- http_proxy : The string URL that will set the HTTP_PROXY environment variable
for Docker containers. Useful in environments with restricted networks where a 
proxy is the only route to the registry to pull images. Setting this option 
forces the Docker daemon to restart. 

- https_proxy : The string URL that will set the HTTPS_PROXY environment 
variable for Docker containers. Useful in environments with restricted networks
where a proxy is the only route to the registry to pull images. Setting this
option forces the Docker daemon to restart.

- no_proxy : The comma-separated list of destinations (domain names or IP
addresses) that will set the NO_PROXY environment variable for Docker
containers. Useful in environments with restricted networks where a proxy is
the only route to the registry to pull images, but you still need to access a
few domains directly (e.g. an internal, private registry). Setting this option
forces the Docker daemon to restart.

- nagios_context : A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the
host name in nagios.If you're running multiple environments with the same
services in them this allows you to differentiate between them. Used by the
nrpe subordinate charm.

- nagios_servicegroups : The comma-separated list of servicegroups that the
generated Nagios checks will belong to.

## Docker Compose

This Charm also installs the 'docker-compose' python package using pip. So
once the Charm has finished installing you have the ability to use [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) functionality such as control files,
and logging.
